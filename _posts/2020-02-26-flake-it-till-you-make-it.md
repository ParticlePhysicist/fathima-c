I am particularly enthusiastic about developing innovative detector systems and conducting detailed data analysis. The research problem I am particularly drawn to is the characterization of the MALTA2 sensor, an advanced prototype of a Depleted Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (DMAPS), developed using 180 nm CMOS imaging technology by Tower Semiconductor. This sensor is vital for the high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC as it aims to improve radiation tolerance and overall performance in the harsh conditions expected at the High-Luminosity LHC.
